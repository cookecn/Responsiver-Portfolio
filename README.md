* Responsive-Portfolio is my second homework assignment for the Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp. This project is the Basic-Portfolio we created first week, but made modified using media queries to allow the page to function properly on multiple screen sizes.

# Contributions
* As of now, this repository should only be changed/altered via Vanderbilt University professors and TA's from the bootcamp.
